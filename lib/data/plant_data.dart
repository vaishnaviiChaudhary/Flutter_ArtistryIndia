        'A mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Asian cultures. It can be understood in two different ways: externally as a visual representation of the universe or internally as a guide for several practices that take place in many Asian traditions, including meditation. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the belief is that by entering the mandala and proceeding towards its center, you are guided through the cosmic process of transforming the universe from one of suffering into one of joy and happiness. \n There are various types of mandalas found in different cultures and used for a multitude of purposes, both artistically and spiritually. Below are three main types of mandalas and how they are used. \n 1. Teaching Mandala \n Teaching mandalas are symbolic, and each shape, line, and color represents a different aspect of a philosophical or religious system. The student creates his or her own mandala based on principles of design and construction, projecting a visual symbolization of everything they have learned. Teaching mandalas serve as colorful, mental maps for their creators. \n 2. Healing Mandala \n Healing mandalas are more intuitive than teaching mandalas, and they are made for the purpose of meditation. Healing mandalas are intended to deliver wisdom, evoke feelings of calm, and channel focus and concentration. \n 3. Sand Mandala \n Buddhist monks and Navajo cultures have long used sand mandalas as a traditional, religious element. These intricate designs use a variety of symbols made from colored sand that represent the impermanence of human life.',

        'Warli painting is a style of tribal art mostly created by the tribal people from the North Sahyadri Range in India. This range encompasses cities such as Dahanu, Talasari, Jawhar, Palghar, Mokhada, and Vikramgadh of Palghar district. This tribal art was originated in Maharashtra, where it is still practiced today.\n  The tribes have also used Warli paintings to impart knowledge. Today, it stands tall among other forms of painting with Maharashtrian artists like Jivya Mashe and his sons Balu and Sadashiv striving hard to keep the art form alive. In fact, Mashe was awarded the Padma Shri in 2011 for making the art form popular in international circuits.',

        'From 17th century temples to stretched canvases in modern homes, Kalamkari is a time-honored and widely beloved form of traditional Indian art. In fact to me, Kalamkari is a reminder of how art is integral to our sense of fulfillment and wellbeing, how it is synonymous with culture and tradition. I firmly believe that art is unique in its ability to connect us to our humanity and our history — and as a distinctly Indian craft, Kalamkari is intertwined with our iconography and mythologies. \n Where is Kalamkari from? \n Kalamkari originated in the modern-day states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana several hundred years ago. It was first used to portray scenes from sacred texts such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Bhagavatam. These paintings were often displayed as decorative backdrops in temples, depicting the stories of deities. \n Why is it called Kalamkari? \n Deriving its name from the word ‘kalam,’ which means pen, ‘Kalamkari’ refers to a particular, intricate style of hand-painting onto cloth. \n What are the different styles of Kalamkari art? \n There are two types of Kalamkari painting: Srikalahasti, which is the freehand drawing style, and Machilipatnam, which is the block-printing technique.',

        'The Gond tribe has its origin in Madhya Pradesh, and derived its name from the word ‘Kond’, meaning “green mountain”. Although Gond art of this tribe is considered to be primarily from Madhya Pradesh, it is also popular in regions like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha. \n The most significant subjects explored and depicted in Gond paintings include birds, animals, and mythical beasts. Since the paintings also derive themes from the daily lives of the people, the Mahua Tree is an important subject. Considered as the Tree of Life, the flowers, fruits, seeds, and leaves from the Mahua tree serve many purposes for the tribe. Urban themes depict modern subjects such as technology and automobiles. Folktales and local deities like Phulvari Devi, Jalharin Devi, and Marahi Devi are of cultural importance. \n The Exquisite Shapes of Gond Art \n The style that is incorporated takes care that the lines, whether of the border or the interior intricacies, that create the subjects grab the attention of the viewer instantly. The dots and dashes enhance the details with exquisite brilliance that is unique to the Gond paintings. Incorporating various geometric shapes and patterns, like the ones resembling fish scales, drops of water and seed shapes flesh out the expressive value of the art. The sense of movement is established through the curves and strokes of the lines, and hence many critics best described it as ‘on line work’. \n The Vivid Colours of Gond Art \n The Gond paintings flourished with vivid colours, especially red, blue, yellow, and white, that serve the view with their excellent contrast. These bright paints are usually derived and extracted from organic sources such as coloured soil, charcoal, plant leaves and sap, and even cow dung. The local sand called Chui Mitti helps in the production of the yellow colour, while Gheru Mitti serves the brown colour. Charcoal provides the black colour, Hibiscus flower gives red, and plant leaves impart green.',

        'What is Aipan Art \n The Kumaon region of Uttarakhand is home to the ritualistic folk art known as Aipan. The word Aipan is derived from the Sanskrit word Lepna, meaning plaster. The Kumaoni Aipan art is mostly drawn on joyous events, festivals, and even funeral rites. It is also believed that this folk art of Uttarakhand has the power to ward against evil. Earlier, the art form could be seen on the walls and floors of homes, but today it is found in various items of apparel or home decor pieces. \n Aipan folk art is inspired by the religious belief of people who practice this art. The patterns typically feature flowers, geometric patterns, conch shells, the swastika, goddess footsteps, and god and goddess images. \n Aipan art is unique in that it always begins and ends with a dot. The dot at the beginning stands for the centre of the universe and is positioned in the centre. All of the other lines and patterns radiate out from the centre, demonstrating how the environment is changing.',
